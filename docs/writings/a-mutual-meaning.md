While many find Nietzsche’s nihilistic interpretation of the meaning of life to be disheartening, I’ve always appreciated the personal agency it permits. To be clear, I don't think I've ever bought into Nietzschian philosophy, as I've always appreciated traditional morality, yet I’ve enjoyed the concept of being able to assign my own meaning to life. Prior to my introduction to Hindu and Buddhist philosophy in The Upanishads and The Other Shore, I was on board with the Nietzschian belief in a lack of inherent meaning to life, yet these texts introduced me to the appealing concept of meaning derived from existence and impact. These philosophies don't rid me of my agency to assign meaning, they’ve equipped me with tools to do so, while also filling the abyss left open by Nietzsche, an inherent meaning to life, our impact on each other.

Eknath Easwaran’s rationale behind his interest in Hindu philosophy in the introduction to his translation of The Upanishads hit rather close to home with me and flipped my preconceived beliefs of meaning on its head. Eswaran acknowledges that he was fortunate in life, having “every innocent source of joy the world offered”, yet despite this seeming success, he was left always looking for more, a greater sense of meaning [^1]. One of the driving forces existing behind my assignment of meaning in my life has been my emotions. When I consider the value or meaning of something, I ask if this thing makes me happy if I derive joy from this thing, and by doing so have found that my life experience has been net-happy, and rather joyful. Like Easwaran, my personal philosophy has granted me lots of sources of joy offered by the world, and I’m quite content with this established mindset. Yet, it's not difficult to look past this facade of joy with the question, does this really matter? While I am often able to answer this question with a simple “yes, as it makes me happy”, I sometimes wonder why my happiness matters in the first place. Like Easwaran, I’ve found an answer to this in these Hindu (and Buddhist) traditions. The Hindu sage’s justification for human actions with the phrase “just for the heaven of it” seems to give more credit to my “yes, as it makes me happy” response than I have given myself.  My happiness matters because I exist and because I exist, anything that makes me happy enough to assign meaning to also matters. The aspect of both Hinduism and Buddhism that I appreciate is that there's not much more to it than that, existence is meaning. Thich Nhat Hanh acknowledges that to exist “is a wonder”, to “be alive”, “breathe in”, and “make one step” is meaningful, valuable, and “already wonderful enough” [^2]. The simple, “ innocent” sources of joy matter because both they exist, and I exist [^3].

While I was initially content with deriving meaning from existence, I found continuing our dive into eastern philosophies to only further rid me of skepticism, specifically the Elon Musk question, how do we know we (and everything else) truly exists? How can we be sure that we arewere not in a simulation? Questions like these have never proved to cause me any existential dread, as my mindset has always paralleled that of Havelock Ellis seen in his quote “Dreams are real as long as they last. Can we say more of life?”. I’ve set aside the potential of reality not being real as insignificant as regardless of its truth, the experiences I’ve experienced must be real, because I've experienced them. While my disregard for this potential fallacy of existence has allowed me to preserve my sanity, Thich Nhat Hanh’s presentation of the concept of Interbeing as a tool to aid in our understanding of the Heart Sutra, also seemingly defines existence in a way that it itself must exist. The single most important given that Hanh outlines as existence is found in his quote “because you are there, I can be here”, without the existence of other things, we ourselves would not exist “nothing can be by itself alone” [^4]. We can be sure both we and everything exists because “we are inextricably interrelated”, our nature is a product of everything else, and everything else is a product of us [^5]. I’ve found through Hanh’s analysis of the Heart Sutra that meaning is derived from existence, and existence only exists because of interbeing. 

If meaning in life is a product of our existence, and our existence only exists because of the existence of everything else, it follows that the meaning of our life stems from the existence of everything else. Naturally, the same logic may be followed for the individual existence of everything, where your existence provides the meaning for someone else’s life. This concept takes the personal agency I appreciated so much before my introduction to Hinduism and Buddhism and expands it massively. The world not only impacts me, but I impact it; I’ve been granted the agency to not only assign meaning and value in my life, but provide meaning for others through these assignments. Hanh uses this concept to justify morality and desire for personal happiness saying “To smile is not to smile only for yourself; the world will change because of your smile” [^6]. I found this mutual importance of everything providing and receiving meaning for/from everything else a reflection of the ‘We’ culture held by many Hindu/Buddhist practicing communities, and this new level of understanding of life’s meaning has not deterred my individuality, but instead caused me to embrace the rest of the world in the same way as I would myself.

I’ve found myself to be more appreciative of others and conscious of my surroundings after my introduction to Hindu and Buddhist texts. Not only have I kept my individual agency to assign value and meaning to the things in life which bring me joy, but these texts have filled the void left by Nietzsche with an inherent meaning. They've equipped me with understand how others impact me, and how I impact them, as well as how without others, there would be nothing. Most importantly, to quote Zach Bershad, the understanding I’ve gained over meaning and value in our reality has catalyzed my ability to create the conditions in life where what I desire may occur.
