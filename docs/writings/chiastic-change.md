Sing, goddess, the change of Achilleus. The first book of The Iliad introduces the anger and emotional rationale of Achilleus through his banter with Agamemnon, contrasting Achilleus’ acknowledgment of fate seen in Book Twenty-Four. While Agamemnon and Achilleus’ plight initially stems from superficial gain, the driving forces of both heroes pivot towards care and companionship in the final book. Homer utilizes a chiastic pattern in the first and last books of his epic, The Iliad, juxtaposing values and reasoning held by Achilleus and emphasizing the acquired wisdom that lead to his change.

Book One of Homer’s epic, The Iliad, outlines “the anger of Peleus’ son Achilleus” through a “bitter collision” with Agamemnon [^1].  Agamemnon steals Achilleus’ prize, Briseis, spurring Achilleus to ponder killing Agamemnon in response, as well as the intervention of Athene, upon Achilleus decision to “[draw] from its scabbard [his] great sword” [^2]. Though Palace Athene attempts to quell Achilleus’ wrath and directs him to not fight, the hero, having “not yet let go of his anger”, remains stubborn in his emotions as he promises the goddess to not combat Agamemnon [^3]. Book Twenty-Four depicts a similar goddess- intervention in the actions of Achilleus with the hero's interaction with his mother, Thetis. The steadfast anger of Achilleus, though now redirected toward Hektor, seems to have remained constant throughout the poem, seen through his dragging of Hektor from behind his chariot at the beginning of Book Twenty-Four. Thetis descends upon Achilleus to calm his “heart’s madness” heald against Hektor and requests the ransom of Hektor's body [^4]. In stark contrast to Achilleus’ emotional rationale depicted in Book One’s goddess intervention, he responds “so be it” to Thetis' request, no longer separating his emotions from the will of the gods.

The conflict between Achilleus and Agamemnon in Book One places the superficial wealth of both kings as more important than the well-being of their people. Achilleus points out Agamemnon’s shameless “profit” focused mindset while himself proclaiming that he desires ‘that [his] people are safe” [^5]. Yet Achilleus is blinded by superficial greed, running awayrunning runs away from battle after losing Briseis to Agamemnon and remaining beside his ships. While both Agamemnon and Achilleus initially fight for superficial prizes and hold wealth above the well-being of their people in Book One, the wisdom brought to both kings by the Trojan war alters their mindset to appreciate companionship over frivolous wealth. In Book 24, Achilleus is offered a ransom for Hektor’s body, a reciprocal gift(?) forto the superficial loss of Achilleus in Book One. While Hektor's father, Piriam, offers a ransom that is “not unworthy” of a deal, Achilleus still apologies to the late Patroklos, promising the sacrifice of a fair “share of the spoils” to him [^5]. Instead of capitalizing on the superficial gain providedprovide by the ransom, Achilleus still mourns for the loss of his beloved companion, willing to exchange the wealth for his companionship with Patroklos. 

Homer’s use of a chiastic pattern in the first and final books of The Iliad illustrates desirable virtues acquired through wisdom. His contrasting repetition of the intervention of a goddess in Achilleus’ actions promotes emotional restraint. Homer ensures that Achilleus remains submissive to the gods on both occasions, maintaining the theological standard presented by the poem, yet clearly contrasts his emotions following both interventions. The wisdom Achilleus acquired from the consequences of his past anger and, the death of Patroklos, drives him to complement his emotions with logic. Similarly, Homer contrasts Agamemnon and Achilleus’ value of superficial wealth over the lives of men with Achilleus’ care for the late Patroklos. By Book Twenty-Four, Achilleus’ focus is no longer on superficial gain, but instead on his companionship with Patroklos. Homer portrays Achilleus’ change in a repeating standard to provide two contrasting models to decision making, one which favors wealth yields consequences such as the death of one's companions, and the other the result of the wisdom gained from prior mistakes. The virtues and decision-making of Book Twenty-Four Achilleus stem from a wisdom Homer enables in the readers of The Iliad, and act as a standard for Homer’s target audience to strive for.

Homer’s contrasts mirrored the events and actions of both Book One and Twenty-Four, such as the goddess's interventions and prioritizing of wealth or companionship, to direct his target audience to desirable virtues. By introducing relatable human qualities in the heroes Agamemnon and Achilleus in the first book and telling of the tragic consequences of their decisions, Homer establishes a model of character for his target audience, providing them with the wisdom gained through the Trojan War.
